# Energy291_Final

This repository is meant to be a storage and communication device for a final project made
by Jonathan Huster and Mattew Tierney for Stanford University's Energy 291: Energy Optimization course.
The project is a global electricity dispatch model modeled after 
Brinkerink et al. 2021 (link: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esr.2020.100592). 

The project will be written primarily with Julia using CLP and JuMP. Others are free (and encouraged) to use 
the model, however do not expect the authors to respond to questions/comments.
